# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

# Dependencies
- Pytorch (1.1)
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

# Installation
Create a virtualenv, install the packages via pip in venv. Alternatively, you can use the latest Nvidia Docker Container of Pytorch for running this project.

# Downloading Pretrained model
The pretrained classification model can be downloaded via [this link](https://we.tl/t-3ALdRFTcOM). THe file size exceeds Github's 100Mb limit, so that it could not be included in this repo directly.
